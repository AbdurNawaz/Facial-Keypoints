# Facial Keypoint Detection

This is a Deep Learning Model combined with various other computer vision techniques to detect Facial Keypoints. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. An example is given below

## Project Overview


![Facial Keypoint Detection][image1]

This project is broken down into three Python notebooks and two Python scripts .

__Notebook 1__    : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

__data_load.py__  : Loading and Preprocessing the Data 

__model.py__      : Defining the model architecture. 

__Notebook 2__    : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

__Notebook 3__    : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN


This Project is inspired from the research paper [Facial Key Points Detection using Deep
Convolutional Neural Network - NaimishNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00977.pdf) and P1 of [Computer Vision nanodegree at Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891)
